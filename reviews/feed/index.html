<h3>What Safety Feature do Highlander 2020 Offers?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Collision with Toyota Safety Sense™ 2.0</li>
<li>The system will warn against any approaching vehicle, pedestrian or any object. Even it can apply brakes automatically when necessary.</li>
<li>Dynamic Radar Cruise Control</li>
<li>You can setup cruise control at low speeds or up to 110mph. You can also preset a distance to maintain from vehicle ahead and follow the path after that vehicle.</li>
<li>Lane Change Alert</li>
<li>It can alert the driver to avoid unintended lane changing events. This feature can even apply little corrective measures (steering inputs) to make vehicle in its lane.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Whats new in 2020 Toyota Highlander?</h2>
<p>Now consumers have even more choices when it comes to three-row midsize SUV. 2020 Toyota Highlander is redesigned with features mix to get a strong position among other options available under same category SUVs.</p>
<p>This new Highlander 2020 is a bit longer and the extra space goes to the cargo area behind last row. The predecessor offers smallest cargo space in the class, however this time it is little improved but still behind its competitors in the market.</p>
<p>The quality of cabin material is improved in 2020 Highlander. On the front dashboard you will find 8-inch touchscreen as standard but in Platinum variant it is 12.3 inches. As an improvement or say new feature, Highlander 2020 supports Android Auto connectivity and Apple CarPlay which is really good thing for me at least.</p>
<p>Engine wise there are not significant changes, however now V6 engine is included as standard engine rather predecessor four-cylinder engine. That&#8217;s why you are able to get smooth and high-speed ride even when you have fully loaded your car both with passengers and cargo.</p>
<p>Although Toyota did a lot with Highlander 2020 but still there is enough room left to work on. That&#8217;s because there are some other newcomers in the market like Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade which are offering spacious interior with luxury options under same category. Overall, Highlander 2020 is worth to consider, but there are some other options too which must also be looked over.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The trucks lover are very keen to know about Toyota Tundra 2021 price, release date &amp; of course about new design. Toyota Tundra have a huge &amp; strong fan base who love to know about the features &amp; specifications of Tundra 2021. The reliability &amp; quality are the main reasons which helps to maintain the brand reputation.<span id="more-85"></span></p>
<p>There is too much which is coming with 2021 Toyota Tundra including under hood changes, interior &amp; exterior design changes. Beside to all that, a hybrid version is also on the track. This is to meet the demands of consumer market who care to make the environment green. Although there are too many rumors in the market which still needs confirmation from any official but we will focus here on authentic information only.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-251 aligncenter" src="https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/toyota-tundra-2021.jpeg" alt="toyota tundra 2021" width="625" height="350" srcset="https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/toyota-tundra-2021.jpeg 625w, https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/toyota-tundra-2021-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/toyota-tundra-2021-446x250.jpeg 446w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h3>What is 2021 Toyota Tundra Price</h3>
<p>The price estimations are only estimates, however there are no final words from officials. As currently we don&#8217;t know what power train will be offered therefore it is really hard to say anything about coming price brackets. However, the current model <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">starts at $33,500</span></em> we expect that Tundra 2021 will also offer the base version at the same price bracket with just a slight upward creep.</p>
<h3>What will be Release Date for Tundra 2021</h3>
<p>Tundra 2021 will be available in 2020 as 2021 model. The exact date is unknown yet, but we will keep track of it and update our users. Many experts expects that Toyota Tundra 2021 will be <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">available for sale in late 2020</span></em>.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s New in 2021 Toyota Tundra Design</h2>
<p>It will be a fully boxed truck which will focus on efficiency and performance. An entire new platform is offered which is also known as F1. The improvements which are on the way also includes <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>increased towing capacity</em></span>. Beside to that consumer also needs an increase in Payload capacity which we found out in a survey. Rear axle is expected to have some enhancements while air suspension will try to improve performance &amp; comfort levels.</p>
<p>The exterior design will give Tundra 2021 a complete new look. There are rumors that a <em><strong>single cab</strong></em> model will also be available in Toyota Tundra 2021 but there must be a confirmation from officials on this.</p>
<p>A new infotainment system is expected along with many interior improvements. You can also expect a fully new cabin layout including dashboard, seats and more. Some more advance technologies are also expected to be included in Tundra 2021 from many experts. We also <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not expect any significant changes</span></em></strong> in cabin size, however some small enhancements may be offered. This is because Tundra already offer biggest cabins if compared to other trucks, however, the final words must be from company.</p>
<h3>Is Toyota Tundra 2021 Hybrid Available?</h3>
<p>The exact details are not available at this point of time. However, it is anticipated that new model will offer hybrid version from many experts. There are rumors that hybrid will be based on V6 engine which is quite similar to Lexus LS 500h. However, in our opinion <em><strong>Tundra will offer more power</strong></em> then Lexus LS 500h, as currently that engine only offers 355 hp. Some experts are saying that Tundra 2021 will offer 450 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque. If that&#8217;s right then 2021 Toyota Tundra can offer a nice towing power.</p>
<h3>Will Tundra 2021 Offer V8 Variations?</h3>
<p>Many of us like V8 engine due to a number of reasons, we expect that Toyota <em><strong>will offer current V8 5.7-liter</strong></em> engine. Although some modifications can be expected to improve the efficiency. However, this is a fact that current version offers very <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">disappointing mileage of 13 mpg</span></em> within city &amp; 17 mpg on long trips. Considering this many of us may switch to hybrid version to save on gasoline expense but that will surely be a trade-off between power and fuel consumption.</p>

<h2>Ford Bronco 2021 New Design</h2>
<p>Ford Bronco 2021 will be a mid-sized SUV and you can get two and four door variations. The new Ford Bronco will be built at Body-on-frame chassis and it will also share its underpinning with Ranger midsize pickup.</p>
<p>The engine is rumored to have at least one EcoBoost. It will probably a 2.3-liter which will be able to make 270 hp along with 310 lb-ft torque just like it is Ranger. It is also rumored that Ford&#8217;s twin-turbo V6 engine can also be used. A 2.7-liter V6 engine will produce 325 hp and 380 lb-ft in prior models of F-150. Most likely it is expected that an automatic transmission will have 10 speed points. However, the manual version may get seven speed intervals.</p>
<p>A hybrid 2021 Bronco is also coming as part of electrification plans. The hybrid version is confirmed and Bronco Hybrid will probably borrow the former 3.3-liter V-6 engine with an electric-motor while offering 10-speed auto transmission. Beside to that it can also follow Explorer and Escape hybrid techniques but the final words not said yet.</p>
<h3>Ford Bronco 2021 Interior &amp; Exterior</h3>

<p>The exterior design sticks to a boxy approach to help 2021 Ford Bronco making a different crossover design. The round headlights gives a feel of resemblance to its predecessors.</p>

<p>Bronco Scout could be another name for Baby Bronco which is smaller uni-body crossover for those who don&#8217;t like standard large body. It will be smaller off-road vehicle and experts are saying that body size can be similar to Escape.</p>
