								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The trucks lover are very keen to know about Toyota Tundra 2021 price, release date &amp; of course about new design. Toyota Tundra have a huge &amp; strong fan base who love to know about the features &amp; specifications of Tundra 2021. The reliability &amp; quality are the main reasons which helps to maintain the brand reputation.<span id="more-85"></span></p>
<p>There is too much which is coming with 2021 Toyota Tundra including under hood changes, interior &amp; exterior design changes. Beside to all that, a hybrid version is also on the track. This is to meet the demands of consumer market who care to make the environment green. Although there are too many rumors in the market which still needs confirmation from any official but we will focus here on authentic information only.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-251 aligncenter" src="https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/toyota-tundra-2021.jpeg" alt="toyota tundra 2021" width="625" height="350" srcset="https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/toyota-tundra-2021.jpeg 625w, https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/toyota-tundra-2021-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/toyota-tundra-2021-446x250.jpeg 446w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h3>What is 2021 Toyota Tundra Price</h3>
<p>The price estimations are only estimates, however there are no final words from officials. As currently we don&#8217;t know what power train will be offered therefore it is really hard to say anything about coming price brackets. However, the current model <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">starts at $33,500</span></em> we expect that Tundra 2021 will also offer the base version at the same price bracket with just a slight upward creep.</p>
<h3>What will be Release Date for Tundra 2021</h3>
<p>Tundra 2021 will be available in 2020 as 2021 model. The exact date is unknown yet, but we will keep track of it and update our users. Many experts expects that Toyota Tundra 2021 will be <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">available for sale in late 2020</span></em>.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s New in 2021 Toyota Tundra Design</h2>
<p>It will be a fully boxed truck which will focus on efficiency and performance. An entire new platform is offered which is also known as F1. The improvements which are on the way also includes <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>increased towing capacity</em></span>. Beside to that consumer also needs an increase in Payload capacity which we found out in a survey. Rear axle is expected to have some enhancements while air suspension will try to improve performance &amp; comfort levels.</p>
<p>The exterior design will give Tundra 2021 a complete new look. There are rumors that a <em><strong>single cab</strong></em> model will also be available in Toyota Tundra 2021 but there must be a confirmation from officials on this.</p>
<p>A new infotainment system is expected along with many interior improvements. You can also expect a fully new cabin layout including dashboard, seats and more. Some more advance technologies are also expected to be included in Tundra 2021 from many experts. We also <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not expect any significant changes</span></em></strong> in cabin size, however some small enhancements may be offered. This is because Tundra already offer biggest cabins if compared to other trucks, however, the final words must be from company.</p>
<h3>Is Toyota Tundra 2021 Hybrid Available?</h3>
<p>The exact details are not available at this point of time. However, it is anticipated that new model will offer hybrid version from many experts. There are rumors that hybrid will be based on V6 engine which is quite similar to Lexus LS 500h. However, in our opinion <em><strong>Tundra will offer more power</strong></em> then Lexus LS 500h, as currently that engine only offers 355 hp. Some experts are saying that Tundra 2021 will offer 450 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque. If that&#8217;s right then 2021 Toyota Tundra can offer a nice towing power.</p>
<h3>Will Tundra 2021 Offer V8 Variations?</h3>
<p>Many of us like V8 engine due to a number of reasons, we expect that Toyota <em><strong>will offer current V8 5.7-liter</strong></em> engine. Although some modifications can be expected to improve the efficiency. However, this is a fact that current version offers very <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">disappointing mileage of 13 mpg</span></em> within city &amp; 17 mpg on long trips. Considering this many of us may switch to hybrid version to save on gasoline expense but that will surely be a trade-off between power and fuel consumption.</p>
