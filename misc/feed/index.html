<p>Most of us download YouTube videos for offline watching when there is no internet access. Especially this is very helpful when you are going on a long trip by plane or trains.</p>



<p>Similarly downloading YouTube videos is an awesome feature when you want to save money on mobile data or mobile internet is not reliable. In such a situation you can use your home or office WiFi to download the videos and then continue using your mobile data with peace of mind.</p>



<span id="more-21"></span>



<h3><figure><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-649" src="https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Download-Youtube-Videos.jpeg" alt="Download Youtube Videos" width="625" height="350" srcset="https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Download-Youtube-Videos.jpeg 625w, https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Download-Youtube-Videos-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Download-Youtube-Videos-446x250.jpeg 446w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></figure></h3>



<h3>Is it Legal to Download YouTube Videos?</h3>



<p>When it comes to downloading videos from YouTube there is a side question comes in mind; Is it legal? It is a tricky question but in general if you are downloading a video for personal use then most probably it is okay. However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms">Google&#8217;s Terms of service for YouTube</a> states that users shall not download some or any content until unless there is a &#8220;Download&#8221; or similar link available for that content by YouTube.</p>



<p>If you are looking to just extract audio or music from a video then here are some <a href="https://solveiglara.net/2020/02/19/youtube-mp3-converter/">best YouTube to MP3 converters</a> and luckily this approach works on all devices.</p>



<p>YouTube does offer few ways by which one can download YouTube Videos legally either via app or web portal. Today here we will discuss the options for multiple devices including iPhone, Android, PC and Mac.</p>



<h2>How to Download YouTube Videos Online for Offline Watching</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Youtube-Premium.jpeg" alt="Youtube Premium" class="wp-image-651" srcset="https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Youtube-Premium.jpeg 625w, https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Youtube-Premium-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://solveiglara.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Youtube-Premium-446x250.jpeg 446w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Download YouTube Videos with Premium Plan</h3>



<p>A number of perks are available when you subscribe for YouTube Premium plan https://www.youtube.com/premium and this also includes ability to download YouTube videos for offline watching. There is no need to use any third-party software just you need to subscribe for the plan. There is one month free trial available for new customers you can also use that option.</p>



<p style="padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; background-color: #f4f4f4;"><strong>Note:</strong> One thing to keep in mind that downloaded videos will open in YouTube app, which means you will not be able to play those videos in different players. Moreover, you can&#8217;t move those video files to any other device.</p>



<ul><li>To download a specific video first of all open the video page and look for the &#8220;<em><strong>Grey Download</strong></em>&#8221; button right below the video player click on it. You download will start automatically, once your file gets ready you will be able to see it in Library or Account tab.</li><li>To watch offline videos you must be signed-in to your account, however, you will not be able to upload comments or likes when in offline mode.</li></ul>



<h3>Which formats are available to Download videos from YouTube?</h3>



<p>Almost every popular &amp; major video format is available when you download any clip from YouTube. You can get file formats including MP4, 3GP, AVI and MOV, beside to that you can also adjust the quality of video from various available options. Most of times you can switch between 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p and 1080p to get the desired quality of your video.</p>

<h2>OneDrive for Business VS. OneDrive Basic Overview</h2>
<h4><strong>Introduction to OneDrive Basic</strong></h4>
<p>For newbies, it is basically a cloud storage by Microsoft. If you are a Windows user then you probably have seen it as default storage option in File Explorer in all Windows 8.1 &amp; later versions.</p>
<p>In short, OneDrive is a cloud storage for individuals to keep the files secure and access it later from anywhere and anytime.</p>
<p>You can also share the files with friends and family, just like you do in Google Drive or iCloud. You can also setup two-factor authentication to increase the level of security on the mobile app.</p>
<h3>Is OneDrive Basic FREE to Use?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is FREE to use service and by default when you make an account with Microsoft (i.e. Hotmail, Outlook, Skype, MSN etc) you will get free storage of up to 5GB. However, if you have signed-up before February 2016 you will get 15GB of space in free tier.</p>
<p>You can create folders, to manage your OneDrive look and feel. Moreover, you can also restore previous version of your files. Beside to all that you can also integrate OneDrive with Office. Another feature of embedding allows you to embed videos, files or pictures at any other location.</p>
<p>OneDrive app is available for all mobile devices including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10.</p>
<h3>Introduction of OneDrive for Business for Newbies</h3>
<p>Basically, OneDrive for Business is part of Office 365 and is basically designed for companies. With OneDrive for Business a company can provide cloud storage to its employees and then can manage storage from one central point.</p>
<p>OneDrive for Business comes as part of SharePoint service since 2013 when SharePoint was launched. Since then OneDrive for Business is used to sync the documents on SharePoint across devices. But now OneDrive for Business also works seperately, and companies often use it to collaborate on documents or anything else.</p>
<p>Its totally on you that you want to use OneDrive for Business along SharePoint or as a seperate product. However, OneDrive for Business is accessed a little differently as compared to OneDrive basic. Each employee will have to use Office 365 portal to login or will use Active Directory account created with SharePoint sites feature.</p>
<p>There are very detailed administration options when you are using OneDrive for Business for documents sharing or collaboration. You can also install in on your own servers and there is no obligation to remain stick with cloud server.</p>
<h3>What is OneDrive for Business Pricing</h3>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plan 1 starts at $5/month</span></em> when you commit annually. You will get 1TB of storage space but this plan will not include the Office Apps. It allows you to save files of up to 15GB in size, share files internally or to external clients/vendors. You can also sync files locally to view it offline later on.</p>
<p>If you buy the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plan 1 at 8.25/month</span></em> with anual commitment then you can also use Microsoft Office 365 along with all the basic funtions above. You are able to use MS Word, OneNote, PowerPoint &amp; Excel from your browser after sign-in to Office.com</p>
<p>The <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plan 2 will cost $10/month/user</span></em> when you commit annually. This plan comes without Office 365 support with unlimited Storage and have some advance feature for theft and information protection.</p>
<p>Last plan &#8220;<em><strong>Microsoft Office 365 Business Premium&#8221;</strong></em> will <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cost $12.50/month</span></em> when you commit annually. It allows maximum of 300 users and it can be used on up to 5 devices by each user. Office 365 plan offers a wide range of options and functionalities and it also offers OneDrive for Business plan 1. It mainly focuses on SMBs needs so that they can get a full cover for all types of technical needs.</p>
<h3>OneDrive for Business File Sharing VS. OneDrive Basic File Sharing</h3>
<p>Both interface allows you to share files and you can edit permissions before generating the sharing link. Anyone with the link can access the document anonymously or with an email address.</p>
<p>OneDrive basic and OneDrive 365 both allows you to quickly look in to who has access which file or document. When you are using SharePoint with OneDrive for Business then there are little more function to create custom permission for users when sharing files.</p>
<h3>Collaboration in OneDrive &amp; OneDrive for Business</h3>
<p>Fortunately, both OneDrive basic and OneDrive 365 allows collaboration via SharePoint. In short all the participants can work on the same document at the same time. There are multiple other things available when you are collaborating which makes the work little more enjoyable. Like there are some integrations options, like Yammer, Oslo and more when using Office 365 with it.</p>
<p>Hope, that this will help a lot to understand the basic difference between both services.</p>
